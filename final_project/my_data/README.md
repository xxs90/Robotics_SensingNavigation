Every dataset we used is stored on Google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13_z45tFl9xYl8y7eHGY1H6qEW9LOxmUA?usp=sharing

Please create a single folder for every dataset and store the video in it. Use our KITTI toolkit in this folder to convert video into frames and timeStamps.

For example, create a folder named "DATA00" under /my_data, and store the video in /my_data/DATA00. Then, modify the corresponding path in /my_data/kitti toolkit/video_process.py
